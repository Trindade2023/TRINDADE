# AUTHORS: The Architects of TRINDADE

## 🏛 Main Author & Director
**André Luiz Trindade**
*Chief Architect & Ontological Engineer*

André Luiz Trindade is the founder and visionary behind the **TRINDADE Protocol**. With 62 years of domain intuition and systemic experience, he developed this framework as a response to the "Crisis of Truth" in the age of Generative AI. 

Operating from a legacy workstation (10+ years old), André proved the fundamental thesis of the protocol: **Systemic Logic and Human Sovereignty transcend hardware constraints.** His work establishes a new standard for Enterprise-Grade governance, moving the industry from casual "prompting" to rigorous "Contextual Engineering."

## 🤖 Orchestration Partners (Synthetic Agents)
In accordance with the **Trinity Logic (3-Agent Minimum)**, this protocol was refined and audited through the collaborative friction of heterogeneous intelligences:

*   **Expansion & Strategy Agent (Gemini):** Responsible for methodological expansion, systemic scaling, and architectural documentation.
*   **Adversarial Audit Agent (Claude):** Responsible for the brutal stress-testing, risk identification, and enterprise-readiness certification (Final Score: 9.0/10).

*The TRINDADE Protocol was built using the TRINDADE Protocol—demonstrating a successful autopoietic refinement loop.*

## 📜 Intellectual Legacy
The TRINDADE framework is the culmination of years of work in systemic stability, including the foundation of the **PoPT Protocol (Proof of Time Precision)**. 

André’s mission is to democratize high-level engineering, allowing "Solo Architects" and global enterprises alike to navigate the synthetic ocean with security, accountability, and truth.
