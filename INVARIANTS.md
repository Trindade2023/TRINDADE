# INVARIANTS: The Constants of TRINDADE

In systemic engineering, an **Invariant** is a property that remains unchanged regardless of scale, domain, or agent composition. These are the non-negotiable axioms that define the integrity of the **TRINDADE Protocol**.

If any of these invariants are violated, the process is no longer a "TRINDADE Execution" and the resulting architecture cannot be certified as **Survivable**.

## 💎 1. The Triad of Minimum Cardinality
**Law:** Every decision cycle must involve a minimum of three distinct functional roles.
- **Context:** Bilateral interactions are prone to bias and stalemates. Stability requires a triangle: **Director**, **Proposer**, and **Challenger**.
- **Invariant:** $n \ge 3$.

## 🛡️ 2. The Adversarial Requirement (Friction)
**Law:** No hypothesis is valid until it has survived an explicit, evidence-based attempt at dismantling.
- **Context:** Consensus born of immediate agreement is a systemic failure (Echo Chamber). 
- **Invariant:** Friction is the only path to high-fidelity signal.

## ⚖️ 3. The Supremacy of Constraints
**Law:** Logic and Physics are the ultimate arbiters; opinions are irrelevant.
- **Context:** The **Seed** establishes the laws of the universe for the project. If a proposal violates the Seed's constraints, it is discarded regardless of its "creativity."
- **Invariant:** Physics > Consensus > Opinion.

## ⚓ 4. Informational Immutability (Traceability)
**Law:** A decision does not exist if it cannot be audited, verified, and remains unedited.
- **Context:** Every Synthesis must be anchored by a cryptographic hash (**SHA-256**). Transparency is the root of accountability.
- **Invariant:** Truth is logged or it is lost.

## 🔄 5. The Recursive Mandate (The Spiral)
**Law:** Failure is not an exit point; it is a trigger for a recursive loop.
- **Context:** If the **Audit** identifies a critical flaw, the system does not fail—it resets. The synthesis of the failure becomes the **Seed** for the next evolution.
- **Invariant:** The protocol iterates until survivability is achieved.

## 🤖 6. Agent Neutrality
**Law:** The functional roles (S, E, A, S) are independent of the biological or synthetic nature of the agent.
- **Context:** Whether executed by a human, a simple AI, or a synthetic swarm, the logic of the pillar remains identical.
- **Invariant:** Structure transcends substrate.

## ⚖️ Summary of Force
The **TRINDADE Protocol** exists to prevent the **Capture of Decision**. These invariants ensure that the human (or the Meta-AI Director) remains the sovereign pilot, while the adversarial engine provides the necessary safety net for the age of autonomous systems.
